# Created for recruting purpouses.

## Overview

Project uses React Vite (TypeScript) with ChakraUI. I tried to deploy it simply on github pages, but I struggle to make it run with node 20+, so I contenerized the app and ☁️ **deployed** on my VPS -> https://codiblytask.toadres.pl. Image uses multistage building (with nginx) so it's very lightweight.


## How to run 🚀

As pointed in instruction:
```bash
npm i && npm run start
```
## Accomplished
- ✔️ products fetching
- ✔️ products filtering by id
- ✔️ pagination
- ✔️ basic toast based error handling
- ✔️ reflect pagination and filtering in the address UR
- ✔️ deploy app on the cloud


## Possible improvements:
- add tests (most important)
- improve error handling
- clean App structure (split the code to new components)
